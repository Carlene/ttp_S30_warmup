-- You're wandering through the wilderness of someone else's code, and you stumble across
-- the following queries that use subqueries. You think they'd be better as CTE's
-- Go ahead and re-write the queries to use CTE's

-- -- EXAMPLE CTE:
--Returns the customer IDâ€™s of ALL customers who have spent more money than $100 in their life.

--YOUR TURN:
